  (or a Derivative Work) that is designed and intended to be integrated into an Application 
  or Derivative Work as an integral and indivisible part of an Application or Derivative Work,

  by Us or Our authorized representatives as **MoltenGL**.

- **"You"** and **"Your"** mean the person, company, or other entity who is being licensed

License Grant, Title and Term
-----------------------------

Upon receipt of the appropriate annual License Fee, We hereby grant You a non-exclusive license 
for use of the Software by a single Developer for the period of one year, to be used to create 
a single Application, for use according to the requirements specified in the **What You May Do** 
and **What You May Not Do** sections of this Agreement.

We retain all ownership, right, title, copyright, naming rights, trademarks, and interest in
the Software and Documentation, including all component source code, compiled code, Libraries, 
documents, examples, tutorials, images, photographs, videos, and any other components of the
Software and Documentation.

This is an annual License. Unless identified otherwise in writing, this Agreement is effective 
immediately and will remain in effect for one year. This Agreement will automatically terminate 
after a period of one year, or if You fail to comply with any material term or condition of 
this Agreement. You may renew this License annually by paying the appropriate annual License Fee.
You agree, upon termination of this Agreement, by either You or Us, and for any reason, to 
immediately destroy all copies of the Licensed Software in Your possession or control.

All restrictions listed in the **What You May Not Do** section of this Agreement will
survive the termination of this Agreement.

From time to time, We may make available updates and upgrades to the Software and Documentation 
and, unless otherwise indicated, You will receive access to all upgrades as long as Your annual
License Fee is current.

As the requirements for future versions of the Software may change, We reserve the right to
unilaterally modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement for any future version, update,
or upgrade of the Software.

This Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by You and Us. This Agreement and 
all related actions and proceedings will be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario
and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein without regard to conflicts of laws 
provisions, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale 
of Goods, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts in the City of Toronto 
in the Province of Ontario, Canada. In the event of litigation between You and Us concerning 
this Agreement, the prevailing party in the litigation will be entitled to recover legal 
fees and expenses from the other party.

If any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction 
to be unenforceable or invalid, then that provision will be stricken from this Agreement 
without affecting the rest of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement 
will continue to be valid and enforceable.



What You May Do
---------------

- You may assign this License to a single Developer, for use on a single Application, for use
  over a period of one year.

- Except as identified herein, while evaluating the Software, You may use the Software and
  Documentation, under the terms of this Agreement, without paying the applicable License Fee. 
  Notwithstanding this evaluation phase,  before distributing any Application (or upgrade of
  that Application) making use of the Software, You must pay the License Fee for each Developer 
  contributing to the Application (or upgrade of that Application).

- You may use the Software when creating or upgrading a single Application and, upon payment 
  of the applicable License Fees for all Developers who contributed to the Application, You 
  may distribute an unlimited number of copies of the Application, as long as the Application
  was finished or upgraded within the one year period of this License. For clarity, there is 
  no time limit on the distribution, or use by Your users, of Your Application, as long as the
  Application was compiled and finished within the one year period of this License.

- You may use an *unlicensed* version of the Software when creating a Derivative Work, and You
  may distribute an unlimited number of copies of the finished Derivative Work using or containing
  the unlicensed Software. Your Derivative Work must include the requirement that any developers
  using Your Derivative Work must adhere to the terms of this License. You may repeat this for any
  number of Derivative Works.

- You may make a limited number of copies of the Software and Documentation for backup and 
  archival purposes, provided that the original and all copies are kept in Your possession 
  and that the backup copies are only used by the single Developer to whom this License applies.

- You may transfer this License to another Developer, as long as the previous Developer 
  no longer uses this License.

The Software and Documentation remain Our proprietary intellectual property and are protected
by copyright laws and international treaties.

  for evaluation purposes.

- You may not use any part of the Software to create or upgrade an Application other than the single

  without first paying the applicable License Fee for all Developers who contributed to the Application.

- You may not include a Framework in an Application in a way that would allow the Framework to be
  separated from the Application and used independently from the Application.

- You may not distribute a Derivative Work, or incorporate any part of the Software into a framework, 
  library, tool, application, or other software used by Developers, unless each Developer using such 
  a Derivative Work or other item holds a valid License to the Software, and adheres to the terms of 
  this License, or unless You have obtained permission from Us to do so, through a separate written 
  agreement with Us.

- You may not use any part of the Software to develop, or cause to be developed, any application, 
  tool, framework, library, or other software that can be used as an alternative to any part of 
  the Software by You or a third party. 

- You may not make copies of the Licensed Software, except for backup purposes as identified in 
  the **What You May Do** section of this Agreement.

---------------------------

We warrant that for a period of 90 days after delivery of this copy of the Software to You, 
the Software will perform in material compliance with the Documentation.

We represent and warrant that We are the copyright holder of the Software and Documentation, 
that the granting of this License does not violate any other agreement, copyright, or ownership
right, and that We are not aware of any claims or allegations that any or all of the Software
infringes, violates, or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of any third party.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY IS IN LIEU 
OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

Our entire liability and Your exclusive remedy for breach of the foregoing warranty will be, 
at Our option, to  repair or replace the Software, or refund the purchase price.

IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS,

DEALER OR DISTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES), OR FOR ANY CLAIM 
BY ANY OTHER PARTY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability 
for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to You.

You may not use the Software in a situation where the Software's failure to perform can 
reasonably be expected to result in physical injury or loss of life. Any such use by You
is entirely at Your own risk, and You agree to hold Us harmless from any claims or losses
relating to such unauthorized use.

that belong to Us and it is being made available to You in strict confidence. ANY USE OR 
DISCLOSURE OF THE SOFTWARE, OR OF ITS ALGORITHMS, PROTOCOLS OR INTERFACES, OTHER THAN IN

TRADE SECRET OR PATENT RIGHTS.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Us,
Our affiliates, and Our and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from
and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, 
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses arising out of or accruing from Your use of the

or other intellectual property right of any third party, or defames any third party or
